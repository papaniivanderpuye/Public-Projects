I wrote my parsing algorithm in Python. it can be run like this:

>>python main.py

python is the python is the Python execution program of version 3.6.5 or higher 
and main.py is the main code file that executes functions in parse.py.

parse.py reads lines from space.txt,comma.txt,pipe.txt and outputs them 3 types of
sorting to target.output.txt

I used the modules  csv,datetime and operator for my code, the are all internal modules.
